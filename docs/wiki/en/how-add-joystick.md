# How to Add Game Controller in Kodi

When the window pops up, it will default to setting the `Circle` button. After clicking the specific button on your controller, it will prompt you to set the `Cross` button, and so on. After completing the setup, click the Save button. If during the setup process, your controller doesn't have a corresponding button for a certain key, you can long-press any key to skip.

After completing the setup, click `Save`.
